# biozsh — the z in bioinformatics

The command line is the usual working environment in bioinformatics. This repository gathers scripts and tweaks to improve the handling of biological data and programs when using the [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/). This includes extensions to the famous z shell autocompletion system which outshines bash.


## Installation

I still have to figure out, how to do a proper installation. But this should work for now:

    git clone https://github.com/kloetzl/biozsh
    cd biozsh
    make install-dev

Restarting the shell will give you access the new features.
